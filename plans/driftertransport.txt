DRIFTER TRANSPORT

Producer - no interface, just tells route to make drifter at $Point. Drifter drifts.

Consumer - two options.
          a) Have one method:
               boolean accept(Resource)
             which is called by the drifter to let it consume the transported 'Resource' and return if it has accepted it
          b) 2 methods 1 to ask if can consume and another to then consume
I like (a)

WALKER TRANSPORT

Producer - produces walkers
   has to know what consumers are in range and if they are accepting for each product we produce
   Also has to know the route to each consumer. It may be possible to have more than one route so this needs to have some logic for deciding.


Consumer - consumer the resources
  has to know what producers are in range and tell them if they are accepting or not

If a walkers route or destination means it can no-longer deliver make it distruct.
