Apoptosis - cell suicide.

Lysosomes - hold enzymes to destroy cells

Siderophores - sent out to find iron ions

Antimicrobial peptides - embedded in membranes, cause pores - cell leaks

"Biology is the science of exceptions."

prokaryotes
- archea, bacteria
- v. simple
- membrane with stuff
- DNA in the middle - but no real nuclei
- things diffuse (wrong)

eukaryotes
- more compartments, more structure

viruses

prions
- misfolded proteins

DNA -> RNA -> Protein
 - but not really.
